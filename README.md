# 04-Code-Quiz

**Description** : The goal of this project was to create a timed coding quiz that prompted questions when the start button was clicked and saved the final score in a Highscores page.

**Deployed Web App**: [Alex's Code Quiz](https://ambertrand.github.io/04-Code-Quiz/)

**Developer Notes**: For this project I was tasked with developing a timed code quiz that the user could take by answering the questions as they were prompted then adding their initials and final score to the Highscores page.  Starting out I was able to get the different pages needed set.

When I got to the Javascript it took a lot longer to make sure everything worked properly and that the quiz ran through the questions.  I did have to make some edits to my questions by turning the choices into an array so I could pull all of them together instead of one by one.

Below is are some images of the finished product.
